## Purpose of the Project
The main aim of the project is to gather information on an individual. The Project aims to determine what data of yours is out there for others to access or just want to see if the person or the organization that contacted you online is legitimate. OSINT, or Open-Source Intelligence, is the driving force behind the project. OSINT is information gathering from publicly available sources and the analysis of that information to provide actionable intelligence. It is hard to say what Information is floating in the digital ocean. While we cannot control everything that is out there about us, it is important to be at least aware about it.
